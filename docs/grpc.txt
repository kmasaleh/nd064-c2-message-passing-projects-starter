The gRPC persons api service contains two api's.
The first one to GetAllPersons rpc method which gets all the persons in the database,
it takes nothing and retrieve a list of the persons.
A person is defined as the following protobuf message :
message PersonMessage{
    int32 id =1;
    string first_name = 2;
    string last_name = 3;
    string company_name = 4;
}
An integer to represent the person identity and three strings to represents the person's first, last and company names.
The returned list of persons is defined as the following protobuf message:
message PersonsMessage {
    repeated PersonMessage persons =1;
}.

The second rpc api is GetPerson which takes a id message :
PersonIdMessage {
    int32 id =1;
}
And it returns a unique PersonMessage as the same message as described before.
